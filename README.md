I am a Columbia University graduate student pursuing a Master's in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS) with a focus on data science. I have undergraduate degrees in finance and economics and a masterâ€™s in international studies with a focus on global economic development and the Middle East. I care about social inequality issues and I am interested in the data for social good movement. I am intrigued by the idea that we can leverage data to address some of the worldâ€™s most pressing problems to improve society.
